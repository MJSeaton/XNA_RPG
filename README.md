XNA_RPG
=======

The relevant code cleaned by patching together a few tutorials on fractal terrain generation and isometric graphics using c# and microsoft's now depricated XNA framework



Note-  This is a functioning engine for terrain generation and 2d isometric graphics for a turn-based isometric RPG. the file Game1 is provided as an exmaple of how to use and access it.
initially, the camera is set to the top left corner of the map, so must be moved (with the arrow keys) to see the results of the terrain generation.

As you might expect, the XNA 4.0 framework must be installed for this program to run and the library to function correctly.
